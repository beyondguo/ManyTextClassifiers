# ManyTextClassifiers
Here, I record many useful text classifiers. Most of them are implemented in Keras.
I try to use the simplest codes for each model, which aims to deliver the main ideas behind each model.

List of models implemented:
- Basic Unsupervised W2V approach
- RNNs
- TextCNN
- LEAM(Lable Attention)

To be implemented:
- RCNN
- GCN
- HAN
- ...
